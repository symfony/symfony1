Templating in practice : Other helpers
=====================================

Overview

Symfony offers a few helpers to quickly manipulate text.

Text helpers
------------

### truncate_text

For no-wrap width-limited blocks - for instance in `select` tags - you may need to allow a maximum number of characters and truncate the rest if needed. To that purpose, you should use the `truncate_text` helper:

    [php]
    <?php use_helper('Text') ?>
    
    <?php echo truncate_text($text, $length , $truncate_string = '...') ?>
    
    // For instance, if $text="You can't stop me ! You can't stop me ! You can't stop me ! You can't stop me !"
    <?php echo truncate_text($text, 30) ?>
    // will be output as
    You can't stop me ! You can't ...

### excerpt_text
    
Websites that offer full-text search need to show where the text was found. This is another type of truncation, and the helper that does it is `excerpt_text`:

    [php]
    <?php echo excerpt_text($text, $sentence, $radius = 100 , $truncate_string = '...') ?>
    
    // For instance, if $text="Finding a word in an ocean of text can sometimes be a real pain."
    <?php echo excerpt_text($text, 'ocean', 10) ?>
    // will be output as
    ...ord in an ocean of text c...

### highlight_text

Maybe you need to highlight a sentence in a text:

    [php]
    <?php echo highlight_text($text, $sentence, [$highlighter]) ?>
    //$highlighter is the class 'highlight' by default
    
    // For instance, if $text='The best PHP framework is symfony'
    <?php echo highlight_text($text, 'symfony') ?>
    // will be output as
    The best PHP framework is <span class="highlight">symfony</span>

### simple\_format\_text

Or maybe you need to format an ASCII text to HTML:

    [php]
    <?php echo simple_format_text($text) ?>

`simple_format_text` surrounds paragraphs with `<p>...</p>` tags, and converts line breaks into `<br />`. Two consecutive newlines (\n\n) are considered as a paragraph, one newline (\n) is considered a line break, three or more consecutive newlines are turned into two newlines. It might be useful to display, for instance, data entered by the user in a textarea.

### auto\_link\_text

Another useful helper finds all the URLs in a text and turns them into hyperlinks

    [php]
    <?php echo auto_link_text('my homesite is www.mysite.com') ?>
    // will generate in HTML
    my homesite is <a href="http://www.mysite.com">www.mysite.com</a>
