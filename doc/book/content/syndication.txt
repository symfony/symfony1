How to build a syndication feed
===============================

Overview
--------

Whether your application lists posts, images, news, questions or anything else, if the update rate is higher than once a month, you must provide a syndication feed (RSS, Atom, etc.) to your users so that they can keep up-to-date about your website from within a feed aggregator. The good news is, if your object model is built in the right way, this won't take you more than a couple lines to develop, since symfony provides a feed builder plugin that does it all for you.

Introduction
------------

The example explored in this chapter is an simple blog application with a `Post` and an `Author` table:

Post        | Author
----------- | ---------
id          | id
author_id   | first_name
title       | last_name
description | email
body        |
created_at  |

The `Post` class is extended by a `->getStrippedTitle()` method that transforms the title into a string that can be used in an URI, replacing spaces by dashes, upper case by lower case, and removing all special characters:

    [php]
    public function getStrippedTitle()
    {
      $text = strtolower($this->getTitle());

      // strip all non word chars
      $text = preg_replace('/\W/', ' ', $text);
      // replace all white space sections with a dash
      $text = preg_replace('/\ +/', '-', $text);
      // trim dashes
      $text = preg_replace('/\-$/', '', $text);
      $text = preg_replace('/^\-/', '', $text);

      return $text;
    }

The `Author` class is extended by a custom `->getName()` method as follows:

    [php]
    public function getName()
    {
      return $this->getFirstName().' '.$this->getLastName()
    }

If you need more details about the way to extend the model, refer to the [model chapter](model.txt).

The `routing.yml` contains the following rule:

    post:
        url:   /permalink/:stripped_title
        param: { module: post, action: read }

If you need more details about the routing system, refer to the [routing chapter](routing.txt).

A special `feed` module is built for the occasion, and all the actions and templates will be placed in it.

    $ symfony init-module myapp feed

Expected result
---------------

The feed action has to output an [Atom][1] feed. As a reminder of all the information that need to be included in an Atom feed, here is an example:

    [xml]
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">

      <title>The mouse blog</title>
      <link href="http://www.myblog.com/" />
      <updated>2005-12-11T16:23:51Z</updated>
      <author>
        <name>Peter Clive</name>
        <author_email>pclive@myblog.com</author_email>
      </author>
      <id>4543D55FF756G734</id>

      <entry>
        <title>I love mice</title>
        <link href="http://www.myblog.com/permalink/i-love-mice" />
        <id>i-love-mice</id>
        <author>
          <name>Peter Clive</name>
          <author_email>pclive@myblog.com</author_email>
        </author>
        <updated>2005-12-11T16:23:51Z</updated>
        <summary>Ever since I bought my first mouse, I can't live without one.</summary>
      </entry>

      <entry>
        <title>A mouse is better than a fish</title>
        <link href="http://www.myblog.com/permalink/a-mouse-is-better-than-a-fish" />
        <id>a-mouse-is-better-than-a-fish</id>
        <author>
          <name>Bob Walter</name>
          <author_email>bwalter@myblog.com</author_email>
        </author>
        <updated>2005-12-09T09:11:42Z</updated>
        <summary>I had a fish for four years, and now I'm sick. They smell.</summary>
      </entry>

    </feed>

Install the plug-in
-------------------

Symfony provides a `sfFeed` plug-in that automates most of the feed generation. To install it, use the symfony command line:

    $ symfony plugin-install local symfony/sfFeed
    
This installs the classes of the plug-in in the `myapp/lib/symfony/plugins/` directory, because the `local` option tells symfony to install the plug-in for the current application only. You could have installed it for all your projects by replacing `local` by `global`.

If you want to learn more about plug-ins, how they extend the framework and how you can package the features that you use across several projects into a plug-in, read the [plug-in chapter](http://www.symfony-project.com/content/book/page/plugin.html) of the symfony book.

Build the feed by hand
----------------------

In the `feed` module, create a `lastPosts` action:

    [php]
    public function executeLastPosts()
    {
      $feed = sfFeed::newInstance('atom1');

      $feed->setTitle('The mouse blog');
      $feed->setLink('http://www.myblog.com/');
      $feed->setAuthorEmail('pclive@myblog.com');
      $feed->setAuthorName('Peter Clive');

      $c = new Criteria;
      $c->addDescendingOrderByColumn(PostPeer::CREATED_AT);
      $c->setLimit(5);
      $posts = PostPeer::doSelect($c);

      foreach ($posts as $post)
      {
        $item = new sfFeedItem();
        $item->setFeedTitle($post->getTitle());
        $item->setFeedLink('@permalink?stripped_title='.$post->getStrippedTitle());
        $item->setFeedAuthorName($post->getAuthor()->getName());
        $item->setFeedAuthorEmail($post->getAuthor()->getEmail());
        $item->setFeedPubdate($post->getCreatedAt('U'));
        $item->setFeedUniqueId($post->getStrippedTitle());
        $item->setFeedDescription($post->getDescription());

        $feed->addItem($item);
      }

      $this->feed = $feed;
    }

The initial [factory][2] method creates an instance of the `sfFeed` class for the 'Atom' format. The `sfFeed` and `sfFeedItem` classes are symfony add-ons made especially for feed construction. At the end of the action, the `$feed` variable contains a `sfFeed` object which includes several `sfFeedItem` objects. To transform the object into an actual Atom feed, the `lastPostsSuccess.php` template simply contains:

    [php]
    <?php echo $feed->getFeed() ?>

The template must not be decorated by a layout. In addition, the resulting page has to be declared as a `text/xml` content-type. So add a `view.yml` in the `feed` module `config/` directory:

    all:
      has_layout: off

      http_metas:
        content-type: text/xml

When called from a feed aggregator, the result of the action is now exactly the Atom feed described above:

    http://www.myblog.com/feed/lastPosts

Use the short syntax
--------------------

The use of all the setters for the item construction can be a little annoying, since there is a lot of information to define. Symfony provides a short hand syntax that produces the same effect, using an associative array:

    [php]
    public function executeLastPosts()
    {

      $feed = sfFeed::newInstance('atom1');

      $feed->setTitle('The mouse blog');
      $feed->setLink('http://www.myblog.com/');
      $feed->setAuthorEmail('pclive@myblog.com');
      $feed->setAuthorName('Peter Clive');

      $c = new Criteria;
      $c->addDescendingOrderByColumn(PostPeer::CREATED_AT);
      $c->setLimit(5);
      $posts = PostPeer::doSelect($c);

      foreach ($posts as $post)
      {
        $item = array(
          'title'       => $post->getTitle(),
          'link'        => '@permalink?stripped_title='.$post->getStrippedTitle(),
          'authorName'  => $post->getAuthor()->getName(),
          'authorEmail' => $post->getAuthor()->getEmail(),
          'pubdate'     => $post->getCreatedAt(),
          'uniqueId'    => $post->getStrippedTitle(),
          'description' => $post->getDescription(),
        );

        $feed->addItemFromArray($item);
      }

      $this->feed = $feed;
    }

It has exactly the same effect, but the syntax is clearer.

Let symfony do it for you
-------------------------

As the method names that are used to build a news field are more or less always the same, symfony can do exactly as above with only:

    [php]
    public function executeLastPosts()
    {

      $feed = sfFeed::newInstance('atom1');

      $feed->setTitle('The mouse blog');
      $feed->setLink('http://www.myblog.com/');
      $feed->setAuthorEmail('pclive@myblog.com');
      $feed->setAuthorName('Peter Clive');

      $c = new Criteria;
      $c->addDescendingOrderByColumn(PostPeer::CREATED_AT);
      $c->setLimit(5);
      $posts = PostPeer::doSelect($c);

      $feed->setFeedItemsRouteName('@permalink');
      $feed->setItems($posts);

      $this->feed = $feed;
    }

Isn't it pure magic?

The magic of the `sfFeed` object
--------------------------------

The getter functions of the `Post` object are so clear that even symfony can understand them. That's because the `sfFeed` class has built-in mechanisms to deduce relevant information from well-organised classes:

-   To set the item `title`, it looks for a `->getFeedTitle()`, a `->getTitle()`, a `->getName()` or a `->__toString()` method.

    In the example, the `Post` object has a `->getName()` method.

-   To set the `link`, it looks for an feed item route name (defined by a `setFeedItemsRouteName()` call). If there is one, it looks in the route url for parameters for which it could find a getter in the object methods. If not, it looks for a `->getFeedLink()`, `->getLink()`, `->getUrl()` method.

    In the example, one route name is defined above in the action (`@permalink`). The routing rule contains a `:stripped_title` parameter and the `Post` object has a `->getStripped_Title()` method, so the `sfFeed` object is able to define the URIs to link to.

-   To set the author's email, it looks for a `getFeedAuthorEmail` or a `getAuthorEmail`. If there is no such method, it looks for a `->getAuthor()`, `->getUser()` or `->getPerson()` method. If the result returned is an object, it looks in this object for a `getEmail` or a `getMail` method.

    In the example, the `Post` object has a `->getAuthor()`, and the `Author` object has a `->getName()`. The same kind of rules is used for the author's name and URL.

-   To set the publication date, it looks for a `->getFeedPubdate()`, `->getPubdate()`, `->getCreatedAt()` or a `->getDate()` method.

    In the example, the `Post` object has a `getCreatedAt`

The same goes for the other possible fields of an Atom feed (including the categories, the summary, the unique id, etc.), and you are advised to [browse the source of the `sfFeed` class](http://www.symfony-project.com/trac/browser/plugins/sfFeed/lib) to discover all the deduction mechanisms.

All in all, the way the accessors of the `Post` and `Author` objects are built allow the built-in shortcuts of the `sfFeed` to work, and the creation of the feed to be so simple.

Define custom values for the feed
---------------------------------

In the list presented above, you can see that the first method name that the `sfFeed` object looks for is always a `->getFeedXXX()`. This allows you to specify a custom value for each of the fields of a feed item by simply extended the model.

For instance, if you don't want the author's email to be published in the feed, just add the following `->getFeedAuthorEmail()` method to the `Post` object:

    [php]
    public function getFeedAuthorEmail()
    {
      return '';
    }

This method will be found before the `->getAuthor()` method, and the feed will not disclose the publishers' email addresses.

Use other formats
-----------------

The methods described below can be transposed to build other RSS feeds. Simply change the parameter given to the feed factory:

    [php]
    // RSS 0.91
    $feed = sfFeed::newInstance('rssUserland091');
    // RSS 2.01
    $feed = sfFeed::newInstance('rss201rev2');
