How to use plugins
===================

Overview
--------

If you want to extend symfony, the plugin system ensures you a great flexibility for distribution, upgrade and clean separation with the rest of the framework. Based on the PEAR extension, the symfony plugin system allows to distribute custom libraries or modules.

What is a plugin?
------------------

A plugin is a packaged extension for a symfony project. 

Plugins can contain classes, helpers, configuration, tasks, modules, schemas and model extensions of their own. The symfony autoloading mechanism takes plugins into account, and the features offered by a plugin are available in the project as if part of the framework. 

Plugins are easy to install, upgrade and uninstall. They can be distributed as a `.tgz` archive, a PEAR package or a simple checkout of a code repository. The PEAR packaged plugins have the advantage of managing dependencies, being easier to upgrade and automatically discovered. 

All the plugins installed in a given project appear as sub-directories of the `plugins/` directory.

Installing a plugin
--------------------

According to the way a plugin is packaged and to its method of broadcasting, the installation may differ. Always refer to the included README file and/or installation instructions on the plugin download page. Also, always clear the symfony cache after installing a plugin. 

All the methods described below result in putting all the files of a plugin into a `plugins/pluginName/` directory.

### Archive plugins

If you download a plugin as an archive, then just unpack this archive into your project's `plugin/` directory, clear the cache, and you're done.

### PEAR plugins

Some plugins are hosted on PEAR channels. For instance, the `symfony` channel contains a few plugins. Install them with the `plugin-install` task, and don't forget to mention the channel name.

    $ cd myproject
    $ symfony plugin-install channelName/pluginName
    $ symfony cc

You will find quite a number of plugins in the [symfony wiki](http://www.symfony-project.com/trac/wiki/SymfonyPlugins). Each plugin has its own page, and is bundled as an attachment to the page. To install such a plugin, use the `plugin-install` task with a full URL:

    $ cd myproject
    $ symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/pluginName
    $ symfony cc

Alternately, if you downloaded a PEAR package, replace the channel name by the absolute path to the package archive.

    $ cd myproject
    $ symfony plugin-install /home/john/downloads/pluginName.tgz
    $ symfony cc

### Plugins from a version control repository

Plugins sometimes have their own source code repository for version control. You can install them by doing a simple checkout in the `plugins/` directory, but this can be problematic if your project itself is under version control. 

Alternatively, you can declare the plugin as an external dependance so that every update of your project source code also updates the plugin source code. For instance, Subversion stores external dependencies in the `svn:externals` property. To add a plugin, just edit the property and update your source code.

    $ cd myproject
    $ svn propedit svn:externals plugins
      pluginName   http://svn.example.com/pluginName/trunk
    $ svn up
    $ symfony cc

### Module activation

Some plugins contain a whole module. The only difference between module plugins and classical modules is that module plugins don't appear in the `myproject/apps/myapp/modules/` directory (to keep them easily upgradeable) and need to be enabled in the `settings.yml` file:

    all:
      .settings:
        enabled_modules:  [default, sfMyPluginModule]

This is to avoid that a plugin module becomes available by mistake for an application that doesn't require it, which could open a security breach.

### Upgrading and uninstalling

To uninstall a plugin, just remove its directory from `plugins/` and clear the cache.

To upgrade a plugin, either use the `plugin-upgrade` task (for a PEAR plugin) or do a `svn update` (if you grabbed the plugin from a version control repository).

Additionally, call the `plugin-upgrade-all` task to upgrade all the plugins installed with the command line.

What you can put in a plugin
----------------------------

### Plugin file structure

A plugin directory is organized more or less like a project directory. The files that you put in the plugin directories are loaded by symfony when needed, provided that you put them in the right place.

    myPlugin/
      config/
        *schema.yml        // data schema
        *schema.xml
        config.php         // specific plugin configuration
      data/
        fixtures/
          *.yml            // fixtures files
        tasks/
          *.php            // pake tasks
      lib/
        *.php              // classes
        helper/
          *.php            // helpers
        model/
          *.php            // model classes
      modules/
        */                 // modules
          actions/
            actions.class.php
          config/
            module.yml
            view.yml
            security.yml
          templates/
            *.php
          validate/
            *.yml
      web/
        *                  // assets

### Plugin abilities

A few remarks concerning what you can put in these directories:

* **Schemas** are detected by the propel tasks. When you call `propel-build-model` in your project, you rebuild the project model and all the plugins model. Beware that all classes defined in a plugin schema must provide a `package` attribute under the shape `plugins.pluginName.lib.model`.

        propel:
          my_plugin_foobar:
            _attributes:    { phpName: myPluginFoobar, package: plugins.myPlugin.lib.model }
            id:
            name:           { type: varchar, size: 255, index: unique }
            ...

* **PHP Configuration** is included in the application bootstrap script (`config.php`). In a plugin `config.php`, you have access to the file path constants, the `sfConfig` class (but the configuration is empty) but not to the autoloading. Use this file to add directories to the PHP include path for instance.

* **Fixtures** files are taken into account by the `propel-load-data` command

* **Tasks** are immediately available to the symfony command line as soon as the plugin is installed. Type `symfony` to see the list of available tasks, including the ones added bu plugins.

* **Custom classes** are autoloaded just like the ones you put in your project `lib/` folders.

* **Helpers** are automatically found when you call a `use_helper()` inclusion in the templates of the project

* **Model classes** in `myplugin/lib/model/` specialize the model classes generated by the Propel builder (in `myplugin/lib/model/om/` and `myplugin/lib/model/map/`). They are, of course, autoloaded. Beware that you cannot override the generated model classes of a plugin in your own project directories.

* **Modules** provide new actions accessible from the outside, provided that you declare them in the `enabled_module` setting in your application. Think about a plugin that provides frontend and backend modules. You will need to enable the frontend modules only in your `frontend` application, and the backend ones only in the `backend` application. This is why plugin modules are not enabled by default.

* **Web** assets are made available to the server, by creating a symlink to the project `web/` directory, if the system allows it, or by copying the content of the module `web/` directory into the project one. Beware that the module assets are automatically supported only when you install a plugin via the command line. If the plugin is installed from an archive or a version control repository, the copy to the project `web/` directory has to be done by hand, and the README bundled with the plugin should mention it.

### Manual plugin setup

There are some elements that you can't include automatically in a plugin that have to be done manually at installation:

* **custom application configuration** can be used in the plugin code (for instance, by using `sfConfig::get('app_myplugin_foo')`) but you can't put the default values in an `app.yml` located in the plugin `config/` directory. To handle default values, use the second argument of the `sfConfig::get()` method. The settings can still be overridden at the application level.

* **routing rules** have to be added manually to the application `routing.yml`. Plugins with specific routing rules should put them in the embedded README file.

### Customizing a plugin for an application
   
Whenever you want to customize a  plugin, **never alter the code of the `plugins/`** directory. IF you do so, you will lose all your modifications when you upgrade the plugin. For customization needs, plugins provide custom settings, and they support overriding.

Well designed plugins use **settings** that can be changed in the application `app.yml`.

    // example plugin code
    $foo = sfConfig::get('app_my_plugin_foo', 'bar');
    
    // Change the 'foo' default value ('bar') in the application app.yml
    all:
      my_plugin:
        foo:       barbar

The module settings and their default value are often described in the README file.

You can replace the default contents of a plugin **module** by creating a module of the same name in your own application. It is not really overriding, since the elements in your application are used instead of the ones of the plugin. It works fine if you create **templates** and **configuration** files of the same name as the ones of the plugins.

On the other hand, if a plugin wants to offer a module with the ability to override its **actions**, the `actions.class.php` in the plugin module must be empty and inherit from an autoloading class, so that the method of this class can be inherited as well by the `actions.class.php` of the application module.

    [php]
    // in myPlugin/modules/mymodule/lib/myPluginmymoduleActions.class.php
    class myPluginmymoduleActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeIndex()
      {
        // Some code there
      }
    }
    
    // in myPlugin/modules/mymodule/actions/actions.class.php
    class mymoduleActions extends myPluginmymoduleActions
    {
      // Nothing
    }
    
    // in myapp/modules/mymodule/actions/actions.class.php
    class mymoduleActions extends myPluginmymoduleActions
    {
      public function executeIndex()
      {
        // Override the plugin code there
      }
    }

How to package a plugin for PEAR
--------------------------------


To override the plugins schema files, you must copy them to your projects config directory, and if they do not contain the PluginName,prefix them with the `PluginName-`, for the example above, you would have make a copy of the plugins schema.yml file, and prefix it `PluginName-`, to produce `PluginName-schema.yml` in your project's config directory. This file will then be used instead of the plugin file when building the model.

Plugins provided as PEAR packages are easier to upgrade, can declare dependencies and automatically deploy assets in the `web/` directory. All you need to do to package a plugin as a PEAR package is to add a `package.xml` at the root of the plugin and call the `pear package` command.

### `package.xml` 

The `package.xml` follows the PEAR syntax. For instance, here is a typical symfony plugin `package.xml`:

    [xml]
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <package packagerversion="1.4.6" version="2.0" xmlns="http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0" xmlns:tasks="http://pear.php.net/dtd/tasks-1.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://pear.php.net/dtd/tasks-1.0 http://pear.php.net/dtd/tasks-1.0.xsd http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0 http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0.xsd">

The interesting parts here are the `<contents>` and the `<dependencies>` tags. For the rest of the tags, there is nothing specific to symfony, so you can refer to the PEAR  [online manual][2].

### Contents

The `package.xml` describes the plugin file structure with `<dir>` and `<file>` tags. You don't have to use `<dir>` tags, since you can use relative paths in the file names. All files must have a `role="data"` attribute.

Describe in the `<contents>` tag the file structure of your plugin.

### Dependencies

Plugins are designed to work with a given set of versions of PHP, PEAR, symfony, PEAR packages or other plugins. Declaring these dependencies in the `<dependencies>` tag tells PEAR to check that the required packages are already installed, and to raise an exception if not.

You should always declare dependencies on PHP, PEAR and symfony, at least the ones corresponding to your own install, as a minimum requirement. If you don't know what to put, add a requirement for PHP 5.0, PEAR 1.4 and symfony 0.6 (the plugin system changed in an incompatible way between 0.6 and 0.8).

We also recommend that you add a maximum version of symfony for your plugin. This will cause an error message when trying to use your plugin with a more advanced version of the framework, and this will oblige you to make sure that your plugin works correctly with this version before releasing it again. It's better to have an alert and to download an upgrade rather than having a plugin fail silently.

### Naming conventions

To keep the `plugin/` directory clean, we recommend that all the plugin names are in [camelCase][3], start with 'sf' (ex: 'sfShoppingCart', 'sfFeed', etc.) and end with 'Plugin'. Before naming your plugin, check that there is no existing plugin with the same name.

>**Note**: plugins relying on Propel should contain 'Propel' in the name. For instance, an authentication plugin using the Propel data access objects should be called 'sfPropelAuth'.

Plugins should include a `LICENSE` file describing the conditions of use and the chosen license. You are also advised to add a `README` file to explain the version changes, interest of the plugin, effect, installation and configuration instructions, etc.

### Building the plugin

The PEAR component has a command that creates the .tgz archive of the package, provided you call the following command from a directory containing a `package.xml`:

    $ pear package

Once your plugin is built, check that it works by installing it yourself.

Hosting your plugin at symfony-project.com
-------------------------------------------

  * Create your plugin on your machine (don't forget to add some documentation, a license file, a `package.xml` file, ...)
  * Create a PEAR package for your plugin
  * Create a new page on the wiki named `NamePlugin` where `name` is your plugin name and `Plugin` is a mandatory suffix. So, if you create a plugin named `Mojo`, create a wiki page named `MojoPlugin` and your PEAR package must be named `MojoPlugin-1.0.0.tgz` (1.0.0 is the PEAR version).
  * Describe the plugin usage, the license, the dependancies, in the wiki page. Check the existing plugins wiki pages and use them as an example.
  * Add you PEAR package as an attachment to your wiki page (`MojoPlugin-1.0.0.tgz`)
  * Add your plugin to the plugin list on the wiki
