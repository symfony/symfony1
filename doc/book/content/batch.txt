How to write a batch process
============================

Overview
--------

Creating batch processes in symfony is very simple. Batch processes can be used to automate any function that might need to be repeated on a regular basis. Some examples of useful batch functions might include a tool to load the development database with test data, or a production tool to periodically expire accounts, or send batched emails at a scheduled time.

Batch skeleton
--------------

In symfony, a batch process refers to any script that is run outside of the normal web front controller. To create a batch process, you need to define the location, application and environment that the batch process is to use.

This is easily accomplished by creating a PHP file in the `myproject/batch/` directory and starting it with the following:

    [php]
    <?php

    define('SF_ROOT_DIR',      realpath(dirname(__file__).'/..'));
    define('SF_APP',           'myapp'));
    define('SF_ENVIRONMENT',   'prod'));
    define('SF_DEBUG,          false));

    require_once(SF_ROOT_DIR.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'apps'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.SF_APP.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'config'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'config.php');
    sfContext::getInstance();  // Required for batch processes that access the database in symfony >0.6x
 
    // batch process here
    ?>   

This script does nothing, or close to nothing: It defines a path, an application and an environment to get to a configuration, and loads that configuration.  But that's already a lot because it means that all of the code written in your batch process will take advantage of the auto-loading of classes, automatic connection to Propel objects, and the symfony root classes.

> **Note:** If you examine symfony's front controllers (like `web/index.php`) you will find this code extremely familiar.  That's because every web request requires access to the same objects and configuration as a batch process.

The value that you define for `SF_APP` could be the name of any of the applications that you have defined in your project.

The `SF_ENVIRONMENT` has to be initialized with the name of the environment you want to run the batch in. The default possible environments are `prod`, `dev`, and `test`.

The `SF_DEBUG` constant defines whether the configuration has to be parsed every time the batch is run (`true`), or if a cached version can be used to imrpove speed (`false`). In general, the debug mode is used only in development. You can read more about the debug mode in the [debug chapter](debug.txt).

Example batch processes
-----------------------

Below are some examples of batch processes that you might create.

### Loading Test Data

Loading test data in the development and/or test environments is something that happens repeatedly. A PHP batch can automate this process. First, define the data to be loaded in a YAML file with the following format:

    TableName:
      recordlabel:
        column:  value
        column:  value
        
Save one or more data files with this format in a `myproject/data/fixtures/` directory. You can find more about how to create the data population files in the [data files chapter](populate.txt).

The following script excerpt reads all YAML files in the `fixtures/` directory and loads the data into the database defined in the `app/config/databases.yml` configuration file.

    [php]
    // batch process here
    $data = new sfPropelData();
    $data->loadData(sfConfig::get('sf_data_dir').DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'fixtures');
