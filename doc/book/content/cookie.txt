How to achieve persistent sessions with cookies?
================================================

Overview
--------

Symfony offers access to cookies via the `sfWebRequest` and `sfWebResponse` objects. It makes the use of cookies very easy, and persistent sessions are easily achieved.

Cookie getter and setter
------------------------

A cookie is a string stored on the client's computer, written by a web application and readable only by the same application - or domain.

In symfony, the setter and getter for cookies are methods of different objects, but that makes sense. To get a cookie, you inspect the request that was sent to the server, thus using the `sfWebRequest` object. On the other hand, to set a cookie, you modify the response that will be sent to the user, thus using the `sfWebResponse` object. To manipulate cookies from within an action, use the following shorcuts:

    [php]
    // cookie getter
    $string = $this->getRequest()->getCookie('mycookie');
    
    // cookie setter
    $this->getResponse()->setCookie('mycookie', $value);
    
    // cookie setter with options
    $this->getResponse()->setCookie('mycookie', $value, $expire, $path, $domain, $secure);
    
The syntax of the `->setCookie()` method is the same as the one of the basic PHP `setcookie()` function (refer to the [PHP manual](http://www.php.net/setcookie) for more information). The main advantage of using the `sfWebResponse` method is that symfony logs cookies, and that you can keep on reading and modifying them until the response is actually sent.

>**Note**: If you want to manipulate cookies outside of an action, you will need to access the `Request` and `Answer` objects without shortcut:
>
>     $request  = sfContext::getInstance()->getRequest();
>     $response = sfContext::getInstance()->getResponse();
>

Persistent sessions
-------------------

A good use for cookies (apart from basic session handling, which is completely transparent in symfony) is the persistent sessions functionality. Most of the login forms offer a "remember me" check-box which, when clicked, allows the user to bypass the login process for future sessions.

### Basic login

Let's imagine an application where all the modules are secure except the `security` module. The `settings.yml` is configured to handle the request of unauthenticated users to the `security/index` action:

    all:
      .settings:
        login_module:           security
        login_action:           index

The model has a `User` class with at the very least a `login` and a `password` field. The `indexSuccess.php` template shows a login form (without the "remember me" checkbox for now), and handles the submission to the `security/login` action:

    [php]
    public function executeIndex()
    {
    }
    
    public function executeLogin()
    {
      // check if the user exists
      $c = new Criteria();
      $c->add(UserPeer::LOGIN, $this->getRequestParameter('login'));
      $user = UserPeer::doSelectOne($c);
      if ($user)
      {
        // check if the password is correct
        if ($this->getRequestParameter('password') == $user->getPassword())
        {
          // sign in
          $this->getContext()->getUser()->signIn();
          // proceed to home page
          return $this->redirect('main/index');
        }
        else
        {
          $this->getRequest()->setError('password', 'wrong password');
        }
      }
      else
      {
        $this->getRequest()->setError('email', 'this user does not exist');
      }
    
      // an error was found
      return $this->forward('security', 'index');
    }

>**Note**: The verification of the login and password could also be handled in a custom validator for a better domain model logic, as explained in the [askeet tutorial](http://www.symfony-project.com/askeet/6).

Now, let's have a look at this `->signIn()` method in the `myUser` class:

    [php]
    class myUser extends sfBasicSecurityUser
    {
      public function signIn()
      {
        $this->setAuthenticated(true);
      }
    
      public function signOut()
      {
        $this->setAuthenticated(false);
      }
    }

So far this is very basic. But it works fine, as long as you ask the user to login for every session.

### Persistent sessions

To allow for persistent sessions, the server has to store some information in the client's computer (that is were the cookie comes in) remembering who the user is and that he/she successfully logged in before. Of course, for security reasons, the password cannot be stored in the cookie (and, by the way, that would be incompatible with the [sha1 hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_hash_functions) password storage method described in the [askeet tutorial](http://www.symfony-project.com/askeet/6)). So what should be stored in the cookie then? Whatever the cookie stores, it has to be the some data that can be matched to what is in the database, so that the comparison of the two elements achieves the authentication. So, to minimize the risk, a random string will be stored and regenerated every 15 days (the lifetime that will be given to the cookie).

By adding a new `remember_key` column to the `User` table (and rebuilding the model). This new field will store the random key, the key will thus be stored both in the cookie on the client's computer and in the database as part of the user's record. The remember key will be set when a user requests to be remembered, so change the sign-in line in the `login` action by:

    [php]
    // sign in
    $remember = $this->getRequestParameter('remember_me');
    $this->getContext()->getUser()->signIn($user, $remember);

Don't forget to add a `remember_me` checkbox to the `modules/security/templates/indexSuccess.php` form for this to work.

The `->signIn()` method of the `myUser` class has to be modified to set the remember key both in the database and in the cookie:

    [php]
    public function signIn($user, $remember = false)
    {
      $this->setAuthenticated(true);

      if ($remember)
      {
        // determine a random key
        if (!$user->getRememberKey())
        {
          $rememberKey = myTools::generate_random_key();

          // save the key to the User table
          $user->setRememberKey($rememberKey);
          $user->save();
        }
                
        // save the key to the cookie
        $value = base64_encode(serialize(array($user->getRememberKey(), $user->getLogin())));
        sfContext::getInstance()->getResponse()->setCookie('MyWebSite', $value, time()+60*60*24*15, '/');
      }
    }

The `generate_random_key()` method can be anything that you choose which meets with your security requirements. Now, you just need to change the `security/index` action a little bit:

    [php]
    public function executeIndex()
    {
      if ($this->getRequest()->getCookie('MyWebSite'))
      {
        $value = unserialize(base64_decode($this->getRequest()->getCookie('MyWebSite')));
        $c = new Criteria();
        $c->add(UserPeer::REMEMBER_KEY, $value[0]);
        $c->add(UserPeer::LOGIN, $value[1]);
        $user = UserPeer::doSelectOne($c);
        if ($user)
        {
          // sign in
          $this->getContext()->getUser()->signIn($user);
          // proceed to home page
          return $this->redirect('main/index');
        }
      }
    }

This new process reads the cookie and you are done.

>**Note**: If some pages of your website are accessible without authentication, then the `security/index` action is no longer the first action to be executed every time. In order to automatically log users in such cases, you will probably prefer to add a new `rememberFilter` in your application `lib/` directory instead of doing the cookie check in a single action:
>
>     [php]
>     class rememberFilter extends sfFilter
>     {
>       public function execute ($filterChain)
>       {
>         // execute this filter only once
>         if ($this->isFirstCall())
>         {
>           $request = $this->getContext()->getRequest();
>           if ($request->getCookie('MyWebSite'))
>           {
>             $value = unserialize(base64_decode($this->getRequest()->getCookie('MyWebSite')));
>             $c = new Criteria();
>             $c->add(UserPeer::REMEMBER_KEY, $value[0]);
>             $c->add(UserPeer::LOGIN, $value[1]);
>             $user = UserPeer::doSelectOne($c);
>             if ($user)
>             {
>               // sign in
>               $this->getContext()->getUser()->signIn($user);
>             }
>           }
>         } 
>         // execute next filter
>         $filterChain->execute();
>       }
>     }
>
>Of course, you will have to declare this filter in your application `filters.yml` configuration file:
>
>      rememberFilter:
>        class: rememberFilter
>

One last thing: If the user logs out, don't forget to remove the cookie!

    [php]
    public function signOut()
    {
      $this->setAuthenticated(false);
      sfContext::getInstance()->getResponse()->setCookie('MyWebSite', '', time() - 3600, '/');
    }
