How to manage user credentials
==============================

Overview
--------

Symfony offers simple mechanisms to identify a user, manage his credentials and restrict access to certain parts of your applications to authenticated users with certain credentials only.

User identification
-------------------

The authenticated status of the user is set by the `->setAuthenticated()` method of a `sfUser/myUser` object. For instance, if you need to implement a simple version of user identification in a module called `myAccount` with two actions `login` and `logout`, you can write: 

    class myAccountActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeLogin()
      {
        if ($this->getRequestParameter('login') == 'admin')
        {
          $this->getUser()->setAuthenticated(true);
        }
      }
    
      public function executeLogout()
      {
        $this->getUser()->setAuthenticated(false);
      }
    }

User credentials
----------------

For authenticated users, symfony provides an array of credentials in the `sfUser` class that can be set via simple access methods `has`, `add`, `remove` and `clear`. Each credential can have any value.

    $user = $this->getUser();
    // add a credential
    $user->addCredential($credential);
    // add several credentials at once
    $user->addCredentials($credential1, $credential2);
    // check if the user has a credential
    $user->hasCredential($credential)                  =>   true
    // check if the user has one of the credentials
    $user->hasCredentials($credential1, $credential3)  =>   true
    // remove a credential
    $user->removeCredential($credential);
    $user->hasCredential($credential)                  =>   false
    // remove all credentials
    $user->clearCredential();
    $user->hasCredentials($credential1)                 =>   false

Here is an example of credential definition:

    class myAccountActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeLogin()
      {
        if ($this->getRequestParameter('login') == 'superuser')
        {
          $user = $this->getUser();
          $user->setAuthenticated(true);
          $user->addCredential('superuser');
        }
        if ($this->getRequestParameter('login') == 'admin')
        {
          $user = $this->getUser();
          $user->setAuthenticated(true);
          $user->addCredentials('admin', 'superuser');
        }
      }
    
      public function executeRemoveSomeCrendential()
      {
        $user = $this->getUser();
        if ($user->hasCrendential('admin', 'superuser'))
          $user->removeCredential('superuser');
        if ($user->hasCredential('admin'))
          $user->removeCredential('admin');
      }
      
      public function executeLogout()
      {
        $user = $this->getUser();
        $user->clearCredentials();
        $user->setAuthenticated(false);
      }
    }
    

Access restriction
------------------

Now that the user can be authenticated and given credentials, it is time to restrict access to some of your actions to grant access only to a subset of users.

This will be done with the `security.yml` module configuration file. This file can be found in the `myproject/myapp/modules/mymodule/config/` (if it doesn't exist for your module, create it).

For example, to restrict the `read` action of the `myAccount` module to users with 'customer' credential, and the `update` action to the users with 'admin' or 'superuser' credentials, the `security.yml` file of the `myproject/myapp/modules/myAccount/config/` directory will have to look like:

    read:
      is_secure:   on
      credentials: customer
    
    update:
      is_secure:   on
      credentials: [admin, superuser]
    
    all:
      is_secure:  off

What happens when a user tries to access a restricted action depends on his credentials:

*   If the user is identified and has the proper credentials, the action will be executed
*   If the user is not identified, he/she will be redirected to the default `login` action  (default/login). You can configure this action in the `myproject/myapp/config/settings.yml` file.
*   If the user is identified but doesn't have the proper credentials, he/she will be redirected to the default `secure` action (default/secure). You can configure this action in the `myproject/myapp/config/settings.yml` file.

Session expiration
------------------

The session expiration is described in detail in the [user session](user_session.txt) chapter.
