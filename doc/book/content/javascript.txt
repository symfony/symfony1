JavaScript helpers
==================

Overview
--------

Interactions on the client side, complex visual effects or asynchronous communication are common in web 2.0 applications. All that require JavaScript, but coding it by hand is often cumbersome and long to debug. Fortunately, symfony automates many of the common uses of JavaScript in the templates.

Introduction
------------

JavaScript has long been considered as a candy for beginners, without any real use in professional web applications due to the lack of compatibility between browsers. In the late 90s, the word 'DHTML' meant 'unreadable HTML code with embedded JavaScript written three times for compatibility', and it sometimes referred to dynamic web pages that didn't work. 

These days are now over, since the compatibility issues are (mostly) solved and some robust libraries allow to program complex interactions in JavaScript without the need for 200 lines of code and 20 hours of debugging. The most popular advance is called [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29), and will be treated a little further.

For now, all you need to know is... JavaScript. Or maybe forget a little about it, because what will be shown below is how NOT to use JavaScript to do what you would expect JavaScript for. Just reconsider this scripting language as an opportunity to manipulate the DOM on the client side, with all the power that it gives. 

All the helpers described here are available in templates provided you declare the use of the `Javascript` helper:

    [php]
    <?php echo use_helper('Javascript') ?>
    
Some of them output HTML code, some of the output JavaScript code. It will be specified for each of them.

Basic helpers
-------------

The most common use of JavaScript is in a hyperlink that triggers a particular script. In HTML, you would probably write it like that:

    [php]
    <a href="#" onClick="alert('foobar');return none;">Click me!</a>
    
Symfony proposes a helper to write it in a more concise way, the `link_to_function()`: 

    [php]
    <?php echo link_to_function("Click me!", "alert('foobar')") ?>
    
Like the `link_to()` [URL helper](templating_link_helpers.txt), you can add options to the `<a>` tag generated by a `link_to_function()`:

    [php]
    <?php echo link_to_function("Click me!", "alert('foobar')", "class=mylink style=color:#f00 alt=please click me" ) ?>

>**Note**: Just like the `link_to()` helper has a `button_to()` brother, you can trigger a JavaScript from a button (`<input type="button">`) by calling the `button_to_function()` helper. And if you prefer a clickable image, just call `link_to_function(image_tag('myimage'), "alert('foobar')")`.

If you want to write a piece of JavaScript code in your page, instead of writing manually something like:

    [php]
    <script type="text/javascript">
    //<![CDATA[ 
      function foobar()
      {
      ...
      }      
    //]]>
    </script>

You could try the `javascript_tag()` function:

    [php]
    <?php echo javascript_tag("
      function foobar()
      {
      ...
      }          
    ") ?>

One common task in applications that use JavaScript a lot is the update of an element in the page. This is something that you usually write:

    [php]
    <?php echo javascript_tag("
      document.getElementById("indicator").innerHTML = "<strong>Evacuation complete</strong>";
    ") ?>

Symfony provides a helper that produces JavaScript - not HTML - for this purpose, and it's called `update_element_function()`:

    [php]
    <?php echo javascript_tag(
      update_element_function('indicator', array(   
        'content'  => "<strong>Evacuation complete</strong>",
      ))
    ) ?>

You may ask: What's the interest of a helper if it is longer to write than the normal code? Sometimes, you want to insert content *before* an element, or *after* it; you may also want to *remove* an element instead of just updating it, or to do nothing according to a condition. In these cases, the JavaScript code becomes somehow messier, but the `update_element_function()` keeps very readable:

    [php]
    // insert content just after the 'indicator' element
    update_element_function('indicator', array(
      'position' => 'after',      
      'content'  => "<strong>Evacuation complete</strong>",
    ));
    
    // remove the element before the 'indicator' element, and only if $condition is true
    update_element_function('indicator', array(
      'action'   => $condition ? 'remove' : 'empty',
      'position' => 'before',      
    ))

The helper makes your templates easier to understand than any JavaScript code, and you have one single syntax for similar behaviours. That's also why the helper name is so long: It makes the code self-sufficient, without the need of extra commentaries.

AJAX helpers
------------

What if the function updating an element of the page was not in a JavaScript, but a PHP script executed by the server? This would give you the opportunity to change part of the page according to a server response. The `remote_function()` does exactly that:

    [php]
    <?php echo javascript_tag(
      remote_function(array(   
        'update'  => 'myzone',
        'url'     => 'mymodule/myaction',
      ))
    ) ?>

When called, this script will update the element of id `myzone` with the response or the request of the `mymodule/myaction` action. This kind of interaction is called AJAX, and it's the heart of highly interactive web applications. Here is how [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29) describes them:

>_AJAX makes web pages feel more responsive by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes, so that the entire web page does not have to be reloaded each time the user makes a change. This is meant to increase the Web page's interactivity, speed, and usability._

AJAX relies on [XMLHttpRequest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest), a JavaScript object that behaves like a hidden frame, which you can update from a server request and reuse to manipulate the rest of your web page.

An AJAX interaction is made up of three parts: a caller (a link, a button or any control that the user manipulates to launch the action), a server action, and a zone in the page to display the result of the action to the user. Symfony provides multiple helpers to insert AJAX interaction in your templates by putting the caller in a link, a button, a form, or a clock. Beware that this time, these helpers output HTML code, not JavaScript.

For instance, imagine a link that would call a remote function. Symfony writes it like this:

    [php]
    <?php echo link_to_remote('Delete this post', array(
        'update' => 'indicator',
        'url'    => 'post/delete?id='.$post->getId(),
    )) ?>
    
    <?php echo link_to_remote(image_tag('refresh'), array(
        'update' => 'emails',
        'url'    => '@list_emails',
    )) ?>

Notice that the `url` parameter can contain either an internal URI (`module/action?parameters`) or a [routing rule](routing.txt), just like in a regular `link_to()`. The [askeet tutorial](http://www.symfony-project.com/askeet/8) has other examples of `link_to_remote()` uses.

>**Note**: Actions called as remote functions know that they are in an AJAX transaction, and therefore automatically skip the [decoration](view.txt) (i.e. their template is not included in a layout). This exempts you from specifying manually `has_layout: False` in the module `view.yml` for the AJAX views.

The second popular way of interacting with web page is forms. Forms normally call a remote function, but this causes the refreshing of the whole page. The correspondence of the `link_to_function()` for a form would be that the form submission only updates an element in the page with the response of the server. This is what the `form_remote_tag()` helper does.

    [php]
    <?php echo form_remote_tag(array(
        'update'   => 'item_list',
        'url'      => '@item_add',
    )) ?>
      <label for="item">Item:</label>
      <?php echo input_tag('item') ?>
      <?php echo submit_tag('Add') ?>
    </form>

A `form_remote_tag()` opens a `<form>`, just like the `form_tag()` helper does. You are invited to use the symfony [form helpers](templating_form_helpers.txt) in AJAX forms as well as in regular forms.

If you want to allow a form to work both in page mode and in AJAX mode, the best solution is to define it like a regular form, but to provide, in addition to the normal submit button, a second button (`<input type="button" />`) to submit the form in AJAX - symfony calls it a `submit_to_remote()`. This will help you build AJAX interactions that degrade gracefully.

    [php]
    <?php echo form_tag('@item_add_regular') ?>
      <label for="item">Item:</label>
      <?php echo input_tag('item') ?>
      <?php echo submit_tag('Add') ?>
      <?php echo submit_to_remote('ajax_submit', 'Add in AJAX', array(
          'update'   => 'item_list',
          'url'      => '@item_add',
      )) ?>
    </form>

Modern forms can also react not only when submitted, but also when the value of a field is being updated by a user. In symfony, you use the `observe_field()` helper for that:

    [php]
    <?php echo form_tag('@item_add_regular') ?>
      <label for="item">Item:</label>
      <?php echo input_tag('item') ?>
      <?php echo submit_tag('Add') ?>
      <?php echo observe_field('item', array(
          'update'   => 'item_suggestion',
          'url'      => '@item_being_typed',
      )) ?>
    </form>

The `module/action` written in the `@item_being_typed` rule will be called each time the `item` field changes, and the action will be able to get the current `item` value from the `value` request parameter. If you want to pass something else than the value of the observed field, you can specify it as a JavaScript expression in the `with` parameter. For instance, if you want the action to get a `param` parameter, write the `observe_field()` helper as follows:

    [php]
      <?php echo observe_field('item', array(
          'update'   => 'item_suggestion',
          'url'      => '@item_being_typed',
          'with'     => "'param=' + value",
      )) ?>

Note that this helper doesn't output an HTML element, but a behaviour for the element passed as parameter. You will see below more examples of JavaScript helpers assigning behaviours.

If you want to observe all the fields of a form, you'd better use the `observe_form()` helper, which calls a remote function each time one of the form fields is modified.

Last but not least, the `periodically_call_remote()` helper is an AJAX interaction triggered every x seconds. It is not attached to a HTML control, but runs transparently in the background, as a behaviour of the whole page. This can be of great use to track the position of the mouse, autosave the content of a large textarea, etc.

    [php]
    <?php echo periodically_call_remote(array(
        'frequency' => 60,
        'update'    => 'notification',
        'url'       => '@watch',
        'with'      => "'param=' + $('mycontent').value",
    )) ?>

If you don't specify the number of seconds (`frequency`) to wait between two calls to the remote function, the default value of 10 is taken.

>**Note**: The AJAX helpers won't work if the URL of the remote action doesn't belong to the same domain as the current page. This restriction exists for security reasons, and relies on browsers limitations that cannot be bypassed.

Prototype
---------

[Prototype](http://prototype.conio.net/) is a great JavaScript library that extends the possibilities of the client scripting language, adds the missing functions you've always dreamt of, and offers new mechanisms to manipulate the DOM.

The Prototype files are present in the symfony framework `data/web/sf/js/` directory. This means that you can use Prototype by adding in your action:

    [php]
    $this->getResponse()->addJavascript('/sf/js/prototype/prototype');

...or by adding it in the `view.yml`:

    all:
      javascripts: [/sf/js/prototype/prototype]
      
>**Note**: Since the symfony AJAX helpers themselves use Prototype, as soon as you add a remote call to a template through a symfony helper, you also include automatically the Prototype library.

Once the Prototype library is loaded, you can take advantage of all the new functions it adds to the JavaScript core. It is not the purpose of this documentation to describe them all, and you will easily find on the web good documentations of Prototype (for instance [ParticleTree's doc](http://particletree.com/features/quick-guide-to-prototype/), [Sergio Pereira's doc](http://www.sergiopereira.com/articles/prototype.js.html) or the one from [script.aculo.us](http://wiki.script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/show/Prototype)). But as our latest example used the dollar (`$()`) function, let's just have a look at it:

    // In JavaScript,
    node = $("elementID");
    // means the same as 
    node = document.getElementById("elementID");

Other than being short and sweet, the `$()` function makes it short to find something in the DOM, and it is also more powerful than `document.getElementById()` because of its ability to retrieve multiple elements.

    allNodes = $("firstDiv", "secondDiv");

Because programming in JavaScript with Prototype is much more fun than doing it by hand, and because it is also part of symfony, you should really spend a few minutes to read the related documentation.

Remote calls parameters
-----------------------

All the AJAX helpers described above can take other parameters, in addition to the `update` and `url` parameters.

### Position

Just like you did in the `update_element_function()` helper, you can specify the element to update as relative to a specific element by adding a `position` parameter:

    [php]
    <?php echo link_to_remote('Delete this post', array(
        'update'   => 'indicator',
        'url'      => 'post/delete?id='.$post->getId(),
        'position' => 'after',
    )) ?>

This will insert the result of the AJAX call after the `indicator` element. With this method, you can do several AJAX calls and see the answers pile down the `update` element.

The `position` parameter can be defined as:

| Value   | Position
|---------|----------
|`before` | Before the element
|`after`  | After the element
|`top`    | at the top of the content of element
|`bottom` | at the bottom of the content of element

### Conditions

A remote call can take an additional parameter to allow a confirmation of the user before actually submitting the XMLHttpRequest:

    [php]
    <?php echo link_to_remote('Delete this post', array(
        'update'   => 'indicator',
        'url'      => 'post/delete?id='.$post->getId(),
        'confirm'  => 'Are you sure?',
    )) ?>

A JavaScript dialog box showing 'Are you sure?' will pop-up when the user clicks on the link, and the `post/delete` action will be called only if the user confirms his choice by clicking 'Ok'.

The remote call can also be conditioned by a test performed on the browser side (in JavaScript):

    [php]
    <?php echo link_to_remote('Delete this post', array(
        'update'    => 'indicator',
        'url'       => 'post/delete?id='.$post->getId(),
        'condition' => "$('elementID') == true",
    )) ?>

### Script execution

If the response code of the AJAX call (the code sent by the server, inserted in the `update` element) contains JavaScripts, you might be surprised to see that these scripts are not executed by default. This is to prevent remote attack risks, except if the developper knows for sure what code is in the response.

That's why you have to declare the ability to execute scripts in remote responses explicitly with the `script` option:

    [php]
    // If the response of the post/delete action contains JavaScript, allow them to be executed by the browser 
    <?php echo link_to_remote('Delete this post', array(
        'update' => 'indicator',
        'url'    => 'post/delete?id='.$post->getId(),
        'script' => true,
    )) ?>
    
If the remote response contains AJAX helpers (like, for instance, `remote_function()`), be aware that these PHP functions generate JavaScript code, and won't execute unless you add the `'script' => true` option.
    
>**Note**: Even if you enable script execution for the remote response, you won't actually see the scripts in the remote code - that is, if you use a tool to check the generated code. The scripts will execute but will not appear in the code. Although peculiar, this behaviour is perfectly normal.

### Callbacks

One important drawback of AJAX interactions is that they are invisible for the user until the zone to update is actually updated. This means that in case of slow network, or server failure, the user may believe that his action was taken into account while it was not.

This is why it is important to notify the users of the events of an AJAX interaction.

By default, each remote request is an asynchronous process during which various JavaScript callbacks can be triggered (for progress indicators and the likes). All callbacks get access to the 'request' object, which holds the underlying XMLHttpRequest. The callbacks correspond to the events of any AJAX interaction:

| Callback    | Event
|-------------|--------------------
|`before`     | before request is initiated
|`after`      | immediately after request was initiated and before `loading`
|`loading`    | when the remote document is being loaded with data by the browser
|`loaded`     | when the browser has finished loading the remote document
|`interactive`| when the user can interact with the remote document, even though it has not finished loading
|`success`    | when the XMLHttpRequest is completed, and the HTTP status code is in the 2XX range
|`failure`    | when the XMLHttpRequest is completed, and the HTTP status code is not in the 2XX range
|`404`        | when the url returns a 404 status
|`complete`   | when the XMLHttpRequest is complete (fires after success/failure if they are present)

For instance, it is very common to show a loading indicator when a remote call is initiated, and to hide it once the response is received. In a `link_to_remote()`, you can write it like that:

    [php]
    <?php echo link_to_remote('Delete this post', array(
        'update'   => 'indicator',
        'url'      => 'post/delete?id='.$post->getId(),
        'loading'  => "Element.show('indicator')",
        'complete' => "Element.hide('indicator')",
    )) ?>
    
The `show` and `hide` methods, as well as the JavaScript `Element` object, are another useful addition of Prototype.

Visual effects
--------------

Symfony integrates the visual effects of the [script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/) library, to allow you to do more than show and hide divs in your web pages. You will find a good documentation on the effects syntax in the [script.aculo.us wiki](http://wiki.script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/show/VisualEffects). Basically, they are JavaScript objects and functions that manipulate the DOM in order to achieve complex visual effects:

    // highlights the element 'my_field'
    Effect.Highlight('my_field', {startcolor:'#ff99ff', endcolor:'#999999'})
    
    // Blinds down an element
    Effect.BlindDown('id_of_element');
    
    // Fades away an element
    Effect.Fade('id_of_element', 
      { transition: Effect.Transitions.wobble })

Have a look at the [combination effects demo](http://wiki.script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/show/CombinationEffectsDemo) to get a visual idea of what these functions do.

Symfony encapsulates these JavaScript objects in a helper called `visual_effects()`. It outputs JavaScript that can be used in a regular link:

    [php]
    <?php echo link_to_function("Show the secret div", visual_effect('appear', 'secret_div')) ?>
    // will make a call to Effect.Appear('secret_div')

The `visual_effects()` helper can also be used in the AJAX callbacks:

    [php]
    <?php echo link_to_remote('Delete this post', array(
        'update'   => 'indicator',
        'url'      => 'post/delete?id='.$post->getId(),
        'loading'  => visual_effect('appear', 'indicator'),
        'complete' => visual_effect('fade', 'indicator').visual_effect('highlight', 'post_nb'),
    )) ?>

Notice how you can combine visual effects by concatenating them in a callback.

JSON
----

AJAX helpers allow to update more than one element at a time, using the [JSON](http://www.json.org/) syntax. For more information about it, check out the [user submitted documentation](http://www.symfony-project.com/trac/wiki/AjaxAndJSON) in the symfony wiki.

Complex interactions
--------------------

JavaScript also provides tools to build up complex interactions. But the complexity of the implementation makes it quite rare over the Internet, although examples like [google suggest](http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en) (for autocomplete input) or [netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/) (for sortible lists) show that desktop-like interactions are now possible in web applications.

The [script.aculo.us library](http://script.aculo.us/) provides high-level JavaScript functions that symfony integrates as helpers. They allow the following kind of interaction:

* **Autocomplete input**: A text input that shows a list of words matching the user's entry while he/she types in. Examples of the use of the `input_auto_complete_tag()` helper in symfony can be found in the [askeet tutorial](http://www.symfony-project.com/askeet/en/14).
* **Drag and Drop**: The ability to grab an element, move it and release it somewhere else, for a real "put it there" feeling. Refer to the [shopping cart tutorial](http://www.symfony-project.com/tutorial/symfony_ajax.html) for a step-by-step documentation on how to use `draggable_element()` and `drop_receiving_element()` - and a self explaining screencast.
* **Sortable lists**: Another possibility offered by draggable elements is the ability to sort a list by moving its items. The `sortable_element()` helper adds the 'sortable' behaviour to an item, and the symfony book has a dedicated [sortable chapter](sortable.txt) dealing with this feature.
* **Edit in place**: More and more web applications allow users to edit the content of pages directly in the page, without the need to redisplay the content in a form (see a demo [here](http://tool-man.org/examples/edit-in-place.html). the symfony helper that does it is the `input_inplace_editor_tag()`.
