Project creation and the 'symfony' command
==========================================

Overview
--------

This chapter describes the logical structure of a Symfony project, and details the use of the *symfony* command to initiate your project structure.

Introduction
------------

In symfony, a **project** is a set of services and operations available under a given domain name, sharing the same object model. 

Inside a project, the operations are grouped logically into **applications**; an application can normally run independently of the other applications of the same project.

In most cases, a project will contain two applications, one for the front-office, and one for the back-office, sharing the same database. But you can also have one project containing lots of mini-sites, each site being a different application. Note that hyperlinks between applications have to be in the absolute form.

Each application is a set of one or more **modules**, each module bringing a particular feature. A module usually represents a page or a group of pages with a similar purpose. Example modules could be `home`, `articles`, `help`, `shoppingCart`, `account`, etc.

Modules contain **actions**. They represent the various actions that can be done in a module, for instance a `shoppingCart` module can have `add`, `show` and `update` actions. Dealing with actions is almost like dealing with pages in a classic web application.

If this represents too many levels for a beginning project, it is very easy to group all actions into one module, so that the file structure can be kept simple. When the application gets more complex, it will be time to organize actions into logical modules.

An application can run in various **environments** to use, for instance, different configurations or databases. By default, every new application can run in three environments (development, test and production). An application can have as many environments as needed. The difference between environments is the configuration.

For instance, a test environment will log alerts and errors, while a production environment will only log errors. The cache acceleration is often deactivated in a development environment but activated in test and production environments. The development and test environments may need test data, stored in a database distinct from the production one. All environments can live together on the same machine, although a production server generally contains only the production environment.

>**Note**: If you use symfony from a [sandbox](installation.txt), you don't need to setup a project nor an application, since the sandbox already has one 'sf_sandbox' project and one 'frontend' application. You don't need to setup the web server either, since your application is in the `web/` root directory.

Pake
----

SymFony uses a dedicated tool called [Pake][1] to administer projects, applications, and modules. Pake is a php tool similar to the [Rake][2] command, a Ruby translation of the `make` command. It automates some administration tasks according to a specific configuration file called `pakefile.php`. But since you use the `pake` tool just by typing `symfony` in a command line, everything becomes much simpler than it sounds.

To get the full list of the available administration operations, simply type from your project directory:

    $ symfony -T

The description of the CLI tasks used during the early stage of a project follows. A full reference of the CLI tasks is available in the [CLI chapter](cli.txt).

Project setup
-------------

First of all, you must create the directory that will contain all your project files:

    $ mkdir /home/steve/myproject

Then, in order to initialize the project and generate the basic files and directories necessary for runtime, simply type:

    $ cd /home/steve/myproject
    $ symfony init-project myproject

Here is an overview of the file structure created:

    apps/
    batch/
    cache/
    config/
    data/
    doc/
    lib/
    log/
    plugins/
    test/
    web/

>**Note**: If you have specific requirements for your project, symfony can adapt to any custom file structure. All the paths in the symfony scripts use a set of special parameters defined in a file called `constants.php`, which can be customized as described in the [file structure chapter](file_structure.txt).

The `symfony` command must always be called from a project root directory (`myproject/` in the example above), because all the tasks performed by this command are project specific. If called from one of the project subdirectories, the command will raise an error.

Application Setup
-----------------

The project is not yet ready to be seen; it requires at least one application. To initialize it, use the `symfony init-app` command and pass the name of the application as an argument:

    $ symfony init-app myapp

This will create a `myapp` directory in the `apps/` folder of the project root, with a default application configuration and a set of directories ready to host the file of your website: 

    apps/
      myapp/
        config/
        i18n/
        lib/
        modules/
        templates/

Some php files corresponding to the front controllers of each default environment are also created in the project root `web` directory:

    web/
      index.php
      myapp_dev.php

`index.php` is the *production* front controller of the new application. Because you created the first application of the project, symfony created a file called `index.php` instead of `myapp.php` (if you now add a new application called `mynewapp`, the new production front controller will be named `mynewapp.php`). To run your application in the *development* environment, call the front controller `myapp_dev.php`. 

>**Note**: If you carefully read the introduction, you may wonder where the `myapp_test.php` file is located. As a matter of fact, the *test* environment is used to do unit testing of your applications components and doesn't require a front controller. Refer to the [unit testing chapter](test_unit_testing.txt) to learn more about it.

From now on, the `/home/steve/myproject/` directory will be considered as the root of your project. The root path is stored in a constant called `SF_ROOT_DIR`, defined in the file `index.php`, and we will use this name instead of the real path to avoid confusing the readers who aren't named Steve.

Web server setup
----------------

To be able to access and test the new application, the web server has to be configured. Here is an example for Apache, where a new VirtualHost is added in the `httpd.conf` file:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName myapp.example.com
      DocumentRoot "/home/steve/myproject/web"
      DirectoryIndex index.php
      Alias /sf /$sf_symfony_data_dir/web/sf
      <Directory "/$sf_symfony_data_dir/web/sf">
        AllowOverride All
        Allow from All
      </Directory>
      <Directory "/home/steve/myproject/web">
        AllowOverride All
        Allow from All
      </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

>**Note**: In the above configuration, the `$sf_symfony_data_dir` placeholders have to be replaced by your symfony data directory. For example, for a PEAR installation on *nix, you should type:
>
>         Alias /sf /usr/local/lib/php/data/symfony/web/sf
>

>**Note**: On Windows platforms, you will need to add the new server name to the list of hosts in the C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file as follows:
>
>         127.0.0.1       myapp.example.com
>

Restart Apache, and that's it: the newly created application can now be called and viewed through a standard web browser at the url:

    http://myapp.example.com/index.php/

or, in debug mode:

    http://myapp.example.com/myapp_dev.php/

>**Note**: Symfony uses the `mod_rewrite` module to display 'smart' urls. If your version of apache is not compiled with `mod_rewrite`, check that you have the mod_rewrite DSO installed and the following lines in your `httpd.conf`:
>
>     AddModule mod_rewrite.c
>     LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
>
>You will learn more about the smart urls in the [routing chapter](http://www.symfony-project.com/content/book/page/routing.html).

Symfony is compatible with other server configurations. You can, for instance, access a symfony application using an alias instead of a virtual host. To discover more about web server configuration, refer to the [related chapter](web_server.txt).

Module setup
------------

Your new application is not very impressive; it dramatically lacks functionalities. If you want functionalities, you need a module to put them into. Once again, the `symfony` command will be used for that, with the parameters `init-module`, the application name and the new module name:

    $ symfony init-module myapp mymodule

The created tree structure is:

    modules/
      mymodule/
        actions/
        config/
        lib/
        templates/
        validate/

The new module is ready to be used:

    http://myapp.example.com/index.php/mymodule
    
Since you need to start getting to work right away, edit the file `myapp/modules/mymodule/templates/indexSuccess.php` and type in:

    Hello, world !

Save it, refresh the page in the browser and voilà!

Source versioning
------------------

Once the setup of the application is done, it is recommended to start a source versioning process. Symfony natively supports [CVS][3], although [Subversion][4] is recommended. The following examples will show the commands for Subversion, and take for granted that you already have a Subversion server installed and that you wish to create a new repository for your project. For Windows users, a recommended Subversion client is [TortoiseSVN][5]. For more information about source versioning and the commands used here, please consult the [Subversion documentation][6].

The example below assumes that $SVNREP_DIR is defined as an environment variable.  If you don't have it defined, you will need to substitute the actual location of the repository in place of $SVNREP_DIR.

So let's **create** the new repository for the `myproject` project:

    $ svnadmin create $SVNREP_DIR/myproject

Then the base structure (layout) of the repository is created with the `trunk`, `tags` and `branches` directories with this pretty long command:

    $ svn mkdir -m "layout creation" file:///$SVNREP_DIR/myproject/trunk file:///$SVNREP_DIR/myproject/tags file:///$SVNREP_DIR/myproject/branches

This will be your first revision. Now you have to **import** the files of the project except the cache and log temporary files:

    $ cd /home/steve/myproject
    $ rm -rf cache/*
    $ rm -rf log/*
    $ svn import -m "initial import" . file:///$SVNREP_DIR/myproject/trunk

Check the committed files by typing

    $ svn ls file:///$SVNREP_DIR/myproject/trunk/

That seems good. Now the SVN repository has the reference version (and the history) of all your project files. This means that the files of the actual `/home/steve/myproject` directory need to refer to the repository. To do that, first rename the `myproject` directory - you will erase it soon if everything works well - and do a **checkout** of the repository in a new directory:

    $ cd /home/steve
    $ mv myproject myproject.origin
    $ svn co file:///$SVNREP_DIR/myproject/trunk myproject
    $ ls myproject

That's it. Now you can work on the files located in `/home/steve/myproject/` and **commit** your modifications to the repository. Don't forget to do some cleanup and erase the `myproject.origin` directory, which is now useless.

There is one remaining thing to setup. If you commit your working directory to the repository, you may copy some unwanted files, like the ones located in the `cache` and `log` directories of your project. So you need to specify an ignore list to svn for this project. You also need to set full access to the `cache/` and `log/` directories again - SVN doesn't store the access rights:

    $ cd /home/steve/myproject
    $ svn propedit svn:ignore .
    $ chmod 777 cache
    $ chmod 777 log

The default text editor configured for SVN should launch. If this doesn't happen, make subversion use your preferred editor by typing 

    $ export SVN_EDITOR=<name of editor>
    $ svn propedit svn:ignore .

Now simply add the subdirectories of `myproject` that SVN should ignore when committing:

    cache
    log

Save and quit. You're done.
