Configuration explained
=======================

Overview
--------

To be simple and easy to use, symfony employs a default configuration that should answer the most common needs of standard applications without modification. However, it is possible to customize almost everything about how the framework and your application interact with the help of a set of simple and powerful configuration files. With these files, you will also be able to add specific parameters for your applications.

Introduction
------------

The great advantage of web application frameworks is that they give developers full control over many aspects of a web application using configuration files - not hard-to-read code. No need to look for a specific class to change the logging behavior or to transform the way the URLs appear: just write some configuration, and you're done.

However, this approach has two serious drawbacks:

* developers end up writing endless hard-to-type XML files
* in a PHP architecture, every request takes much longer to process

Symfony uses configuration files only for what they are best at doing. As a matter of fact, the ambition of the configuration system in symfony is to be:

* **powerful**: almost every aspect that can be managed using configuration files is managed using configuration files
* **simple**: many aspects of configuration are not shown in a normal application, since they rarely need to be changed
* **easy**: configuration files are easy to read, to modify and to create by the final user (the application developer)
* **customizable**: the default configuration language is YAML, but it can be INI or XML or whatever the preference of the developer is
* **fast**: the configuration files are never processed by the application but by the configuration system, which compiles them into a fast-processing chunk of code for the PHP server

This is not just wishfull thinking, since the PHP implementation of the configuration system actually allows it.

Why YAML ?
----------

Symfony uses by default the [YAML][1] format instead of more traditional INI or XML formats. This decision is based on the great advantages of YAML. Below are some of the pros taken from the YAML website:

* YAML documents are very readable by humans.
* YAML interacts well with scripting languages.
* YAML uses host languages' native data structures.
* YAML has a consistent information model.
* YAML enables stream-based processing.
* YAML is expressive and extensible.
* YAML is easy to implement.

Contrary to INI, it supports hierarchy. Contrary to XML, it doesn't use a complicated syntax with lots of <, > and closing tags. The only disadvantage of YAML is that its is not widely known by developers, for now, as compared to the other formats. However, it is so simple to learn that it would be a pity to miss out on its features just for a lack of fame. As of now, if you are not familiar with the YAML syntax, you should [get started][2] right away.

For those who are attached to other configuration file formats, be reassured: symfony supports any type of configuration file, since they are processed by special handler that can be easily adapted (see the _Configuration handlers_ section at the end of this chapter).

YAML syntax and symfony conventions
-----------------------------------

There are a few conventions that need to be kept in mind when writing YAML files:

* Never use tabs, use spaces instead. The YAML parsers won't be able to understand files with tabs, so indent your lines with spaces (a double blank is the symfony convention for indentation)

        # Never use tabs
        all:
        -> mail:
        -> -> webmaster:  webmaster@mysite.com
        
        # Use blanks instead
        all:
        ¬¬mail:
        ¬¬¬¬webmaster: webmaster@mysite.com

* To define an array as a value, enclose the elements in square brackets or use the developed syntax with dashes:

        # shorthand syntax for arrays
        all:
          params: [value1, value2]
          
        # developed syntax for arrays
        all:
          params: 
            - value1
            - value2

* If your parameters are strings starting or ending with spaces, enclose the value in single quotes. If a string parameter contains special characters, also enclose the value in quotes:

        # strings starting or finishing with spaces are to be enclosed in single quotes
        all:
          param1: This is a normal string
          param2: '  This is a special string '
          param3: 'That''s all folks!'

* To give a boolean value, use either `on`, `1` or `true` for a positive value and `off`, `0` or `false` for a negative one.

        # Boolean values
        true_values:
          - on
          - 1
          - true
        false_values: 
          - off
          - 0
          - false

The [YAML website][2] has an extensive description of the YAML syntax.

Environments
------------

As a reminder, symfony provides three default environments : production (**prod**), test (**test**) and development (**dev**); you can add as many custom environments as you wish.

The different environments share the same php code (apart from the front web controller), but can have completely **different configuration** files. Consequently, each environment can connect to a different database.

In the development environment, the logging and debugging settings are all set to on, since maintenance is more important than performance. On the contrary, the production environment has settings optimized for performance by default, so the production configuration turns many features off.

The case of the test environment is a little special. This environment is used when you execute some code from your project on the command line, and that would mostly happen for unit testing. Consequently, the test environment is close to the production configuration, but it is not accessed through a web browser. It simulates the use of cookies and other HTTP specific components.

To add a new environment, you don't need to create a directory or to use the `symfony` command. Simply duplicate the production front controller (`myproject/web/index.php`) to a file called, say, `index_myenv.php`, and change the `SF_ENVIRONMENT` definition to `myenv` in this file. That's it, you have your new environment. As you will see, this environment inherits all the default configuration plus the settings that are common to all environments.

Configuration levels
--------------------

There are several configuration levels in symfony:

* granularity levels
  * The **default configuration** located in the framework
  * The global configuration for the whole **project** (in `myproject/config/`)
  * The local configuration for an **application** of the project (in `myproject/apps/myapp/config/`)
  * The local configuration restricted to a **module** (in `myproject/apps/myapp/modules/mymodule/config`)
* environment levels
  * specific to one environment
  * for all environments

Of all the properties that can be customized, many are environment-dependent. So many YAML configuration files are divided by environment, plus a tail section for **all** environments. Typical symfony configuration files result looking like:

     # production environment settings
     prod:
       ...

     # development environment settings
     dev:
       ...

     # test environment settings
     test:
       ...

     # custom environment settings
     myenv:
       ...

     # setting for all environments
     all:
       ...

In addition, the framework itself defines default values in files that are not located in the project tree structure, but in the `$data_dir/symfony/config/` directory of your symfony installation. These settings are inherited by all applications:

     # default settings:
     default:
       ...

Part of these default definitions are repeated in the project/app/module configuration files as comments (prefixed with `#`), so that you know that some parameters are defined by default and that they can be modified:

     all:
     #  default_module:         default
     #  default_action:         index
     #
     #  error_404_module:       default
     #  error_404_action:       error404
     #
     #  login_module:           default
     #  login_action:           login

This means that a property can be defined several times, and the actual value results from a definition cascade with the following priority:

1. module
2. application
3. project
3. specific environment
4. all environments
5. default

Not all configuration files are environment-dependent.

Structure
---------

To improve readability of the configuration files, symfony puts the parameter definitions in categories. Here is an example `app.yml`:

     all:
       .general:
         tax:               19.6

       pager:
         max_per_page:      5

       mail:
         webmaster:         webmaster@mysite.com
         commercial:        commerce@mysite.com

The `.general`, `pager` and `mail` lines are category headers. Headers starting with `.` are only for readability and information, whereas the others define a **name space**. A name space allows you to use the same key name for several parameters, provided that they don't share the same name space. This is especially useful when you need to access the values with constants.

Access configuration from code
------------------------------

All the configuration files are eventually transformed into PHP, but some of the parameters need to be accessible from your code. In this case, they are available through a special `sfConfig` class. It is a registry for configuration parameters, with simple getter and setter class methods, accessible from every part of thes code:

     [php]
     sfConfig::set('param_name', $value);         // to define a config 
parameter
     sfConfig::get('param_name', $default_value); // to retrieve a config parameter

So symfony configuration parameters have all the advantages of PHP constants, but without the inconvenients, since the value can be changed.

For instance, if you need to access the values defined in the previous example from your PHP code, write:

     [php]
     sfConfig::get('app_tax');
     sfConfig::get('app_pager_max_per_page');
     sfConfig::get('app_mail_webmaster');
     sfConfig::get('app_mail_commercial');

The name is the concatenation of:

*   a prefix related to the configuration file name (`sf_` for 
`settings.yml`, `app_` for `app.yml`, `mod_` for `module.yml`)
*   the name space (if it is defined), in lower case
*   the name of the key in lower case

The environment is not included, since your PHP code will only have access to the values defined for the environment it's executed in.

How to add a custom setting?
----------------------------

There are two ways of adding custom settings to your code:

* Add new lines to the usual configuration files
  * `myproject/apps/myapp/config/app.yml` for application wide settings
  * `myproject/apps/myapp/modules/mymodule/module.yml` for module wide settings (this files doesn't exist by default)
* Create a new configuration file, together with a new config handler 

For instance, if you need to add the credit card operators accepted in you site, you can write in the application `app.yml`:

     all:
       creditcards:
         fake:             off
         visa:             on
         americanexpress:  on

     dev:
       creditcards:
         fake:             on

To know if the `fake` credit cards are accepted in the current environment, get the value of:

     sfConfig::get('app_creditcards_fake');

But maybe you need to add an array, an associative array or a lot of new parameters. In this case it is better to create a new configuration file, together with the corresponding configuration handler.

Configuration handlers
----------------------

The configuration files, whatever their format, are processed by some special classes called **handlers** that transform them into fast-processing PHP code. To promote interactivity in the development environment, the handlers parse the configuration at each request so that you can see immediately a change in a YAML file. But of course, in the production environment, the processing occurs once during the first request, and then the processed PHP code is stored in the cache. The performance is guaranteed since every request in production will just execute some well-optimized PHP code.

For instance, if your `app.yml` contains:

     all:
       mail:
         webmaster:         webmaster@mysite.com

Then the file `config_app.yml.php`, located in the `cache` folder of your project, will contain:

     [php]
     <?php
     sfConfig::add(array(
       'app_mail_webmaster', 'webmaster@mysite.com'),
     );
     ?>

This is a major advantage over many PHP frameworks, where configuration files are compiled at every request even in production. Unlike Java, PHP doesn't share an execution context between requests. For other PHP frameworks, keeping the flexibility of XML configuration files requires a major performance hit to process all the configuration at every request. This is not the case in symfony: thanks to the cache system, the overhead caused by configuration is very low.

The other main advantage of using configuration handlers is that it allows you to use formats other than YAML. The configuration handlers just transform configuration files into optimized PHP code. If you have a parser for another language - and PHP has native support of XML and INI files - it is very easy to write a custom handler that will read your own configuration file format.

Wrap up
-------

To sum up, just remember the syntax of YAML configuration files:

     environment:
       .header1:
         key1:      value1
         key2:      value2

       namespace1:
         key3:      value3
         key4:      value4

But now, enough of these general considerations, let's dig into the [real configuration files](configuration_practice.txt) and all their marvelous possibilities.
