How to locate a file
====================

Overview
--------

Some scripts in your applications may need to access files without necessarily knowing where they are. If you were using a bash command, you could use `find` to find them. In symfony, you can do it just as easily with the `sfFinder` class. Doing a complex search is just a matter of adding new search criteria, and the result is a simple array if file paths.

The `sfFinder` class
--------------------

The `sfFinder` class if a file finder class based on the Perl [`File::Find::Rule`](http://search.cpan.org/~rclamp/File-Find-Rule/) module. It can find either files or directories (or both), and filters the search by a set of user-defined _rules_. The basic usage is the following:

1. Create a `sfFinder` object for your search by calling the class method `type()`. You must precise what kind of result you expect (either `file`, `dir` or `any`)

        [php]
        $finder = sfFinder::type('file');
        
2. Add rules to refine your search and decrease the number of results

        [php]
        $finder = $finder->name('*.php');
        
3. Launch the search by calling the `in()` method, setting the root directory of the search as argument

        [php]
        $files = $finder->in('/home/production/myproject');
        
All these method calls can be chained to one single line, which is often easier to read:

    [php]
    $files = sfFinder::type('file')->name('*.php')->in('/home/production/myproject');
    // can be read as
    // find files with name matching '*.php' in the '/home/production/myproject' directory

The `in()` method returns an array of files, that can easily be used for file manipulation:

    [php]
    foreach ($files as $file)
    {
      $handle = fopen($file, "r");
      ...
    }

>**Note**: The `sfFinder` class is autoloaded and doesn't need to be required in your scripts.

Rules principle
---------------

The rules used to refine the search are written as method calls of an `sfFinder` object. All methods return the current `sfFinder` object to allow easy chaining.

    [php]
    $finder1 = sfFinder::type('file')->name('*.php');                   // is a sfFinder object
    $finder2 = sfFinder::type('file')->name('*.php')->size('> 10K');    // is also a sfFinder object
    $files = $finder1->in('/home/production/myproject');                // is an array of file paths

All rules may be invoked several times, except for the `in()` method.

Some rules are cumulative (`name()` for example) whereas others are destructive (like `maxdepth()`). For destructive rules, only the most recent method call counts:

    [php]
    // this one will filter for file names satisfying both conditions
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->name('*.php')->name('*Success.*');
    // same as
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->name('*Success.php');
    
    // here, only the last call is taken into account
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->maxdepth(5)->maxdepth(3);
    // same as
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->maxdepth(3);

Filter rules
------------
        
### Filter by name

To filter the results on file names, add calls to the `name()` method with patterns in [glob][1] or [regular expression][2] format:

    [php]
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->name('*.php');
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->name('/.*\.php/');

You can even exclude certain file names from the result, doing negative filtering with the `not_name()` method:

    [php]
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->not_name('Base*');
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->name('/^Base.*$/');

### Filter by size

You can filter your search on file size by calling the `size()` method, which expects a string containing a comparison as argument. The method also understands magnitudes:

    [php]
    // search only for files bigger than 10 kilobytes
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->size('> 10K');
    // search only for files smaller than 1 kilobyte, or exactly that
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->size('<= 1Ki');
    // search only for files being 123 bytes of size
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->size(123);
   
The symbols used for magnitude are the [binary prefix][3] defined by the International System of Units.

### Limiting the search depth

By default, a search made by the `sfFinder` object is recursive and scans all the subdirectories. You can override this default behaviour by using the `maxdepth()` method to set the maximum depth of search in the file tree structure:

    [php]
    // search in directory and subdirectories
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file');
    // search only in the directory passed to the in() method,
    // and not in any subdirectory
    $finder = sfFinder::type('file')->maxdepth(1);
    
Of course, you can also specify a minimum depth by calling the `mindepth()` method.

By default, the minimum depth is 0 and the maximum depth is infinite (or close to).

### Excluding directories

If you want to exclude directories from the search, you can use two methods:

- the `prune()` method stops the search in the part of the tree structure where the pattern given as argument is found. See it as an interdiction to go and see what's in a directory:

        [php]
        // ignore the content of '.svn' folders
        $finder = sfFinder::type('any')->prune('.svn');

    The finder doesn't go deeper in any of the `.svn` folders, but the `.svn` folders themselves are still part of the results.
    
- the `discard()` method removes the files or folders that match the argument from the result, but doesn't stop the tree structure exploration.

        [php]
        // remove the '.svn' folders from the result
        $finder = sfFinder::type('any')->discard('.svn');

These two methods are often used in conjunction, when a directory _and_ its content need to be excluded from a search:

    [php]
    // remove the '.svn' folders and their content from the result
    $finder = sfFinder::type('any')->prune('.svn')->discard('.svn');
    
>**Tip**: To exclude the files and directories added by version control programs, `sfFinder` provides a shortcut method: `ignore_version_control()`. It will prune and discard and prune all files and directories looking like `.svn`, `CVS`, `_darcs`, `.arch-params`, `.monotone`, and `.bzr`.

### Search starting point

The `in()` method is used to specify where the `sfFinder` has to look for files or directories. It can take a file path or an array of file paths as argument:

    [php]
    // search in a single location
    $files = $finder->in('/home/production/myproject');
    // search in several locations
    $files = $finder->in(array('/home/production/myproject', '/home/production/myotherproject'));
    
It can accept either absolute or relative paths:

    [php]
    // absolute path
    $files = $finder->in('/home/production/myproject');
    // relative path
    $files = $finder->in('../projects/myproject');
    
### Returning relative paths

By default, the paths returned by the `in()` method are absolute paths. You can choose to receive an array of relative paths in place, by chaining the call to the `relative()` method before calling `in()`:

    [php]
    // paths results are relative to the root directory
    $files = $finder->in('/home/production/myproject');
    // paths results are relative to the current directory,
    // i.e. the directory of the current script
    $files = $finder->relative()->in('/home/production/myproject');
