Deprecations and removals in 1.3
================================

This document lists all settings, classes, methods, functions, and tasks that
have been deprecated or removed in symfony 1.3.

Core Plugins
------------

The following core plugins have been deprecated in symfony 1.3 and will be
removed in symfony 1.4:

  * `sfCompat10Plugin`: By deprecating this plugin, we also deprecate all
    other elements in the framework that rely on this plugin to work (1.0
    admin generator, and 1.0 form system).

  * `sfProtoculousPlugin`: The helpers provided by this plugin do not
    support unobstrusiveness, and as such should not be used anymore.

Methods and Functions
---------------------

The following methods and functions have been deprecated in symfony 1.3 or
before, and will be removed in symfony 1.4:

  * `sfToolkit::getTmpDir()`: You can replace all occurrences of this method
    by `sys_get_temp_dir()`

  * `sfForm::setInvalidMessage()`: You can replace it by a call to the new
    `sfForm::setDefaultMessage()` method

  * `sfForm::setRequiredMessage()`: You can replace it by a call to the new
    `sfForm::setDefaultMessage()` method

  * `sfTesterResponse::contains()`: You can use the more powerful `matches()`
    method

  * `sfTestFunctionalBase` following methods: `isRedirected()`,
    `isStatusCode()`, `responseContains()`, `isRequestParameter()`,
    `isResponseHeader()`, `isUserCulture()`, `isRequestFormat()`, and
    `checkResponseElement()`: These methods have been deprecated since 1.2,
    and replaced with the tester classes.

  * `sfFilesystem::sh()`: You can replace all occurrences of this method by
    calls to the new `sfFilesystem::execute()` method. Be warned that the
    returned value of this method is an array composed of the `stdout` output
    and the `stderr` output.

  * `sfAction::getDefaultView()`, `sfAction::handleError()`,
    `sfAction::validate()`: These methods have been deprecated in symfony 1.1,
    and they was not really useful. As of symfony 1.1, they need the
    `compat_10` setting set to `on` to work.

  * `sfComponent::debugMessage()`: Use the `log_message()` helper instead.

  * `sfApplicationConfiguration::loadPluginConfig()`: Use
    `initializePlugins()` instead.

  * `sfLoader::getHelperDirs()` and `sfLoader::loadHelpers()`: Use the same
    methods from the `sfApplicationConfiguration` object. As all methods of
    the class `sfLoader` are deprecated, the `sfLoader` class will be removed
    in symfony 1.4.

  * `sfController::sendEmail()`

  * `sfGeneratorManager::initialize()`: It does nothing.

  * `debug_message()`: Use the `log_message()` helper instead.

  * `sfWebRequest::getMethodName()`: Use `getMethod()` instead.

  * `sfDomCssSelector::getTexts()` and `sfDomCssSelector::getElements()`

  * `sfVarLogger::getXDebugStack()`: Use `sfVarLogger::getDebugBacktrace()`
    instead.

  * `sfVarLogger`: The logged `debug_stack` value is deprecated in favor of
    the `debug_backtrace` value.

The following methods and functions have been removed in symfony 1.3:

  * `sfApplicationConfiguration::checkSymfonyVersion()`: see below for the
    explanation (`check_symfony_version` setting)

Classes
-------

The following classes have been deprecated in symfony 1.3 and will be removed
in symfony 1.4:

  * `sfDoctrineLogger`: Use `sfDoctrineConnectionProfiler` instead.

  * `sfNoRouting` and `sfPathInfoRouting`

  * `sfRichTextEditor`, `sfRichTextEditorFCK`, and `sfRichTextEditorTinyMCE`:
    They have been replaced by the widget system (see the "Helpers" section
    below)

  * `sfCrudGenerator`, `sfAdminGenerator`, `sfPropelCrudGenerator`,
    `sfPropelAdminGenerator`: These classes were used by the 1.0 admin
    generator

  * `sfPropelUniqueValidator`, `sfDoctrineUniqueValidator`: These classes were
    used by the 1.0 form system

  * `sfLoader`: see the "Methods and Functions" section

  * `sfConsoleRequest`, `sfConsoleResponse`, `sfConsoleController`

The following classes have been removed in symfony 1.3:

  * `sfCommonFilter`: see the "Removal of the common filter" section of the
    UPGRADE_TO_1_3 file for more information about the consequences and how to
    migrate your code.

Helpers
-------

The following helper groups have been deprecated in symfony 1.3 and will be
removed in symfony 1.4:

  * All helpers related to the 1.0 form system as provided by the
    `sfCompat10Plugin`: `DateForm`, `Form`, `ObjectAdmin`, `Object`, and
    `Validation`

Settings
--------

The following settings (managed in the `settings.yml` configuration file) have
been removed from symfony 1.3:

  * `check_symfony_version`: This setting was introduced years ago to allow
    automatic cache cleaning in case of a change of the symfony version. It
    was mainly useful for shared hosting configuration where the symfony
    version is shared amongst all customers. As this is bad practice since
    symfony 1.1 (you need to embed the symfony version in each of your
    project), the settings does not make sense anymore. Moreover, when the
    setting is set to `on`, the check adds a small overhead to each request,
    as we need to get the content of a file.

  * `max_forwards`: This settings controls the number of forwards allowed
    before symfony throws an exception. Making it configurable has no value.
    If you need more than 5 forwards, you have both a conception problem and a
    performance one.

  * `sf_lazy_cache_key`: Introduced as a big performance improvement in
    symfony 1.2.6, this setting allowed you to turn on a lazy cache key
    generation for the view cache. While we think doing it lazy was the best
    idea, some people might have relied on `sfViewCacheManager::isCacheable()`
    being called even when the action itself wasn't cacheable. As of symfony
    1.3, the behavior is the same as if `sf_lazy_cache_key` was set to `true`.

  * `strip_comments`: The `strip_comments` was introduced to be able to
    disable the comment stripping because of some bugs in the tokenizer of
    some PHP 5.0.X versions. It was also used later on to avoid large memory
    consumption when the Tokenizer extension was not compiled with PHP. The
    first problem is not relevant anymore as the minimum version of PHP needed
    is 5.2 and the second one has already been fixed by removing the regular
    expression that simulated the comment stripping.

The following settings have been deprecated in symfony 1.3 and will be removed
in symfony 1.4:

  * `calendar_web_dir`, `rich_text_js_dir`: These settings are used by the
    Form helper group, which is deprecated in symfony 1.3.

  * `validation_error_prefix`, `validation_error_suffix`,
    `validation_error_class`, `validation_error_id_prefix`: These settings are
    used by the Validation helper group, which is deprecated in symfony 1.3.

Tasks
-----

The following tasks have been removed in symfony 1.3:

  * `project:freeze` and `project:unfreeze`: These tasks used to embed the
    symfony version used by a project inside the project itself. They are not
    needed anymore as the best practice has been to embed symfony in the
    project for a very long time now. Moreover, switching from one version of
    symfony to another is really simple now as you only need to change the
    path in the `ProjectConfiguration` class. Embedding by hand symfony is
    also very simple as you just need to copy the whole symfony directory
    somewhere in your project (`lib/vendor/symfony/` is the recommended one).

The following tasks are deprecated in symfony 1.3, and will be removed in
symfony 1.4:

  * All symfony 1.0 task aliases.

Miscellaneous
-------------

The following behaviors are deprecated in symfony 1.3, and will be removed in
symfony 1.4:

  * The `sfParameterHolder::get()`, `sfParameterHolder::has()`,
    `sfParameterHolder::remove()`, `sfNamespacedParameterHolder::get()`,
    `sfNamespacedParameterHolder::has()`, and
    `sfNamespacedParameterHolder::remove()` methods support for the array
    notation (`[]`) is deprecated and won't be available in symfony 1.4
    (better for performance).

The symfony CLI does not accept anymore the global `--dry-run` option as it
was not used by any symfony built-in task. If one of your task relies on this
option, you can just add it as a local option of your task class.

The Propel templates for the 1.0 admin generator and the 1.0 CRUD will be
removed in symfony 1.4
(`plugins/sfPropelPlugin/data/generator/sfPropelAdmin/`).

The "Dynarch calendar" (found in data/web/calendar/) will be removed in
symfony 1.4 as it is only used by the Form helper group, which will be also
removed in symfony 1.4.
