Upgrading Projects from 1.2 to 1.3
==================================

This document describes the changes made in symfony 1.3 and what need
to be done to upgrade your symfony 1.2 projects.

If you want more detailed information on what has been changed/added in symfony 1.3,
you can read the [What's new?](http://www.symfony-project.org/tutorial/1_3/whats-new) tutorial.

>**CAUTION**
>symfony 1.3 is compatible with PHP 5.2.4 or later.
>It might also work with PHP 5.2.0 to 5.2.3 but there is no guarantee.

How to upgrade?
---------------

To upgrade a project:

  * Check that all plugins used by your project are compatible with symfony
    1.3

  * If you don't use a SCM tool, please make a backup of your project.

  * Upgrade symfony to 1.3

  * Upgrade the plugins to their 1.3 version

  * Launch the `project:upgrade1.3` task from your project directory
    to perform an automatic upgrade:

        $ php symfony project:upgrade1.3

    This task can be launched several times without any side effect. Each time
    you upgrade to a new symfony 1.3 beta / RC or the final symfony 1.3, you
    have to launch this task.

  * You need to rebuild your models and forms due to some changes described
    below:

        $ php symfony doctrine:build-model
        $ php symfony doctrine:build-forms
        $ php symfony doctrine:build-filters

  * Clear the cache:

        $ php symfony cc

The remaining sections explain the main changes made in symfony 1.3 that need
some kind of upgrade (automatic or not).

Deprecations
------------

During the symfony 1.3 development, we have deprecated and removed some
settings, classes, methods, functions, and tasks. Please refer to the
DEPRECATED_IN_1_3 for more information.

Autoloading
-----------

As of symfony 1.3, the files under the `lib/vendor/` directory are not
autoloaded anymore by default. If you want to autoload some `lib/vendor/`
sub-directories, add a new entry in the application `autoload.yml`
configuration file:

    [yml]
    autoload:
      vendor_some_lib:
        name:      vendor_some_lib
        path:      %SF_LIB_DIR%/vendor/some_lib_dir
        recursive: on

The automatic autoloading of the `lib/vendor/` directory was problematic for
several reasons:

  * If you put a library under the `lib/vendor/` directory that already has an
    autoload mechanism, symfony will re-parse the files and add a bunch of
    unneeded information in the cache
    (see #5893 - http://trac.symfony-project.org/ticket/5893).

  * If your symfony directory is not exactly named `lib/vendor/symfony/`, the
    project autoloader will re-parse the whole symfony directory and some
    problems might occur
    (see #6064 - http://trac.symfony-project.org/ticket/6064).

Routing
-------

The `sfPatternRouting::setRoutes()`, `sfPatternRouting::prependRoutes()`,
`sfPatternRouting::insertRouteBefore()`, and `sfPatternRouting::connect()`
methods do not return the routes as an array as they did in previous versions.

JavaScripts and Stylesheets
---------------------------

### Removal of the common filter

The `sfCommonFilter` has been removed. This filter used to automatically
inject the JavaScripts and stylesheets tags into the response content. You now
need to manually include these assets by explicitly call the
`include_stylesheets()` and `include_javascripts()` helpers in your layout:

    [php]
    <?php include_javascripts() ?>
    <?php include_stylesheets() ?>

It has been removed for several reasons:

 * We already have a better, simple, and more flexible solution (the
   `include_stylesheets()` and `include_javascripts()` helpers)

 * Even if the filter can be easily disabled, it is not an easy task as you
   must first know about its existence and its "behind the scene" magic work

 * Using the helpers provides more fined-grained control over when and where
   the assets are included in the layout (the stylesheets in the `head` tag,
   and the JavaScripts just before the end of the `body` tag for instance)

 * It is always better to be explicit, rather than implicit (no magic and no
   WTF effect; see the user mailing-list for a lot of complaints on this
   issue)

 * It provides a small speed improvement

How to upgrade?

  * The `common` filter need to be removed from all `filters.yml`
    configuration files (this is automatically done by the
    `project:upgrade1.3` task).

  * You need to add `include_stylesheets()` and `include_javascripts()` calls
    in your layout(s) to have the same behavior as before (this is
    automatically done by the `project:upgrade1.3` task for HTML layouts
    contained in the `templates/` directories of your applications - they must
    have a `<head>` tag though; and you need to manually upgrade any other
    layout, or any page that does not have a layout but still relies on
    JavaScripts files and/or stylesheets).

Tasks
-----

### Formatters

The `sfFormatter::format()` third argument has been removed.

Escaping
--------

The `esc_js_no_entities()`, refered to by `ESC_JS_NO_ENTITIES` was updated to
correctly handle non-ANSI characters. Before this change only characters with
ANSI value `37` to `177` were not escaped. Now it will only escape backslashes
`\`, quotes `'` & `"` and linebreaks `\n` & `\r`.

Doctrine Integration
--------------------

### Required Doctrine Version

The externals to Doctrine have been updated to use the latest and greatest 
Doctrine 1.2 version. You can read about what is new in Doctrine 1.2 
[here](http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2).

### Admin Generator Delete

The admin generator batch delete was changed to fetch the records and issue the
`delete()` method to each one individually instead of issuing a single DQL query
to delete them all. The reason is so that events for deleting each individual 
record are invoked.

### Override Doctrine Plugin Schema

You can override the model included in a plugins YAML schema simply by defining 
that same model in your local schema.

See: http://trac.symfony-project.org/ticket/6656

With this change you could now create `config/doctrine/sfGuardUser.schema.yml` 
with the following inside.

    sfGuardUser:
      package: sfDoctrineGuardPlugin.lib.model.doctrine
      # ...

You can customize the schema and your local version will be used instead of the
one included in the plugin.

>**NOTE**
>The package option is a feature of Doctrine and is used for the schemas of
>symfony plugins. This does not mean the package feature can be used independently
>to package your models. It must be used directly and only with symfony plugins.

### Query logging

The Doctrine integration logs queries run using `sfEventDispatcher` rather
than by accessing the logger object directly. Additionally, the subject of
these events is either the connection or statement that is running the query.
Logging is done by the new `sfDoctrineConnectionProfiler` class, which can be
accessed via a `sfDoctrineDatabase` object.

Plugins
-------

If you use the `enableAllPluginsExcept()` method to manage enabled plugins in
your `ProjectConfiguration` class, be warned that we now sort the plugins by
name to ensure consistency across different platforms.
